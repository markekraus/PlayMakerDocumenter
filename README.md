## !!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

> [!Warn]
> There are heavy spoilers ahead and in-depth game mechanics are discussed. This is intended for mod authors, speed runners, or anyone interested in the deep mechanics of Luck in Blue Prince. It is recommended you play the game, reach room 46, play it some more, and then come here to learn more about how the game works.
>
> The most spoiler free explanation is that using this mod will improve chances of max items being spawned in rooms. To some extent, this can trivialize some RNG aspects of the game while not completely spoiling the puzzle solving.

## How Luck Works

The game's base luck stat is 10. This mod increases luck to 100. This will greatly improve the odds of a room spawning max items, dirt piles, and improves chances of metal detection items spawning. This does not affect room rarity when drafting or anything thing else. In some limited testing luck over 23 is used for the "very lucky" options when rooms are spawning items. Most rooms have a max of 4 spawned items. Trunks are considered an item for selection along with coins, keys, gems, and special items.

The Lucky Rabbit's Foot gives a +3 to luck in my limited testing for all rooms. Verandas give +12 or +18 luck for green rooms.

The max luck I have achieved with this mod is 121 with 2 Verandas, a Lucky Rabbit's foot, and crafting the courtyard. I also crafted the courtyard with just the 100 luck from this mod. For both, max items and max dig piles spawned, as well as a metal detector item.

## Maid's Chambers

Maid's Chambers subtract 7 luck for each one drafted. With the Chamber of Mirrors and the Secret Passage, it is possible to have 3 Maid's Chambers drafted for a total of -21. With this mod your luck would still be 79 and still high enough for max rewards.

## Verandas

Verandas add 12 total with one and 18 total with two. This gets added on top of the 100 luck for green rooms. So if you have 2 Verandas your luck will be 118 when crafting The Patio. I have not yet tested how Spare Verandas impact green room luck. With Chamber of Mirrors and the Secret Passage it is possible to have 2/3 or 3/2 Verandas/Spare Verandas for a total of 5 green room luck enhancements.

## Cloister of Rynna

The Cloister of Rynna raise your Luck with each Green Room you draft from this Cloister, per it's description. However, I have not tested what the exact impacts are. I first discovered how overpowered luck was when maxing out dual Cloister of Rynnas with the help of Chamber of Mirrors.

## Curses

I have not tested hwo curses impact luck or if they do at all. I have also not tested how luck is in Cursed Mode
